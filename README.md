This is a NodeCG graphics bundle, make sure you have a working NodeCG installation.
- This graphics bundle is controlled with [`cq-overlay-controls`](https://github.com/LeptoFlare/cq-overlay-controls).
- This is a custom graphics bundle that I was commissioned for. If you'd like to commission your own, please see my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/leptoflare) page.
